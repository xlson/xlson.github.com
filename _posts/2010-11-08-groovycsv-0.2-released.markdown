title: GroovyCSV 0.2 Released
---

{{ page.title }}
=========

The first final release of Groovys very own CSV parsing library is out. Also, it's up on Maven Central which should make it a lot easier to get. There have been some minor changes to the API since I posted about csv-parser [the first time](http://xlson.com/2010/08/17/introducing-csv-parser.html) but the biggest change is probably the new name and package structure.

## Changes since 0.1

* Project renamed from csv-parser to GroovyCSV (new package-structure `com.xlson.groovycsv`)
* Explicit `close()` method has been addsed to `com.xlson.groovycsv.CsvIterator`

## Example using @Grab and custom separator

Because GroovyCSV is now up on Maven Central it's really easy to use in your Groovy scripts. This example shows how you can make GroovyCSV available using `@Grab` as well as how you can use custom separators and quote character.

    @Grab('com.xlson.groovycsv:groovycsv:0.2')
    import com.xlson.groovycsv.CsvParser
    
    def csv = '''Name-Lastname
    Mark-'Anderson-Nielsen'
    Pete-Hansen'''
    
    def data = new CsvParser().parse(csv, separator: '-', quoteChar: "'")
    for(line in data) {
        println "$line.Name $line.Lastname"
    }
