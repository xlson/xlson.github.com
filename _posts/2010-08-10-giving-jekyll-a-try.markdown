title: Giving Jekyll a try
---

{{ page.title }}
=========

Today I've spent some time fiddling with the static (blog-aware) site generator
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and this blog is actually created using
it.

Jekyll is interesting (in my opinion) in that it allows me to blog
using [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) which
is a very light-weight template engine and not that much other than
that. It's basically Wordpress without all the fuss.

Jekyll takes the template files and markdown files and builds it all
into static html complete with rss feed and related posts. What it
doesn't do is things like comments, admin gui (duh..). You could go as
far as to say that it's strength lies in that it really doesn't do
anything advanced. It's actually so easy to use that there's no real
template project to start with when you're starting up an new
site. Personally I did what many other have done: "stole" the design
of it's makers [blog](http://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com)

Let's hope this get's me blogging again. Been way to long since the
last time. My old home was on [QBRANCH:CODE](http://code.qbranch.se/)
and I'll probably keep cross-publishing my stuff over there.
