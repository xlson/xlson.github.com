title: Giving Jekyll a try

{{ page.title }}
=========

Today I've spent some time fiddling with the static (blog-aware) site generator
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and this blog is actually created using
it.

Jekyll is interesting (in my opinion) in that it allows you to blog
using a light weight template engine such as
[markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and not much
else. Wordpress is a nice and all but I can't say I've ever had a
really good time while using WYSIWYG on the web and Wordpress is no
exception. Not to mention the complexities of using a big piece of
software for something as simple(?) as a blog. Then we've got the
issue of getting code examples into blog posts. There's lots of
solutions for all these problems out there and probably as many
problems more.

Jekyll is different than a normal blog engine in that it takes the template files and markdown files and builds it all
into static html complete with rss feed and related posts. That html
is what you upload and show your users on your out-of-the-box web server.  What it
doesn't do is things like comments, admin gui (duh..). You could go as
far as to say that it's strength lies in that it really doesn't do
anything advanced. It's actually so easy to use that there's no real
template project to start with when you're starting up an new
site. Personally I did what many other have done: "stole" the design
of it's makers [blog](http://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.com)

Now don't get me wrong, Jekyll isn't for everyone and it's no silver
bullet. But it IS an interesting approach to blogging for us geeks and
I'm going to give it a try for a while.

Let's hope this get's me blogging again. Been way to long since the
last time. My old home was on [QBRANCH:CODE](http://code.qbranch.se/)
and I'll probably keep cross-publishing my stuff over there.
