![Grails Wanted in Sweden (on Twitter)](/images/grails-wanted.png)

If you don't live in Sweden and aren't using [Groovy] the pic above won't mean much to
you. To me it means Groovy devs are wanted in Sweden. The message
translates to:

> [Grails] developers wanted, urgently.

When I started [SweGUG] two years ago together with [Andreas] I was
hoping to see messages like this all the time. That hasn't
really been the case and this is the first time I can recall
seeing someone ask for a swedish Groovy developer on
Twitter. This of course calls for a minor celebratory blogpost :)

Hopefully we'll see more requests like this in the years to come when
developers everywhere realise there's more to the JVM than pure
Java.
