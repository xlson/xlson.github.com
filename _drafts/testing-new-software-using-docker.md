{{ page.title }}
================

Write about how to go from wanting to run a piece of software to
running it an testing it out in no-time using docker.

Talk about workflow, volumes, how to copy configurations out of an
image and how to build upon an image or create your own later on if it
isnt enough.

Possibly talk about docker compose and how to go from the test to an
easily reproducible usage.
